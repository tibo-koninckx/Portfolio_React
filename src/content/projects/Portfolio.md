# Portfolio React

This portfolio is one of my projects that I am proud of. My portfolio is completely built with react. Both front-end and back-end.
It contains an overview of my skills, my projects and a way to contact me. It offers a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to browse through my projects.

- **Frontend**: The frontend is completely developed in react. As a frontend library I use Material UI. 
I use modern react such as functional components, contexts, modern libraries.
My portfolio has a fully responsive design, providing a seamless experience for both desktop and mobile devices.


- **Backend**: The backend of my portfolio is built with nodejs.
